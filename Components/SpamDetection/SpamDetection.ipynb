utterly confidential and  top secret    though i know that a  transaction of this magnitude will make any one  apprehensive and  worried  considering the fact that we have not met  each other before   but i am assuring you that all will be well at the  end of the day  we  have decided to contact you by email due to the  urgency of this  transaction  as we have been reliably informed that  it will take at  least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal  post to reach you   so we decided it is best using the e  mail  which is  quicker and also  to enable us meet up with the second quater payment  for the year     however  let me start by introducing myself properly  to you  i  am dr  tom eke  a director general in the department  of petroleum  resources  d  p  r  and i presently head the contract  award panel incharge  of contract awards and payment approvals  i came to  know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to  handle a very confidential business transaction  which involves the  transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account  requiring  maximum confidence  i and my colleagues are top  officials of the  federal government contract award panel  our duties  include evaluation  vetting  approval for payment of  contract jobs  done for the d  p  r e  t  c  in order to commence this  business we  solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer  into your account  the said funds  the source of this funds is as  follows  in the second  quarter of  this committee was mandated to  review and award  contracts to the tune of us   million us dollars  to a group of five  firms for the supply construction and installation  of oil pipe lines  in warri and port harcourt  during this process my  colleagues and i  decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately  over  inflate the  total contract sum from us   million to us    million united  states dollars with the main intention of sharing  the remaining sum  of us   miilion amongst ourselves   the federal government of nigeria has since the  second quater of  year  approved the sum of us   million for us  as the contract sum   and the sum of us   million has also been paid to  the foreign companies  concerned as contract entitlements for the various  contracts done  but  since the companies are entiltled to us   million  dollars only  we are  now left with us   million dollars balance in the  account which we intend to  disburse amongst ourselves  but by virtue of our  positions as civil  servants and members of this panel  we cannot do  this by ourselves   as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau   civil service  laws  from opening and  or operating foreign accounts  in our names  while still in government service  making it  impossible for us to  acquire the money in our names right now  i have  therefore  been  delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my  colleagues in the  panel to look for an overseas partner into whose  account we would  transfer the sum of us   million  hence we are  writing you this  letter  my colleagues and i have agreed that if you  or your company  can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our  behalf  you or your  company will retain   of the total amount  us    million   while    will be for us  officials  and the remaining    will be used in  offsetting all debts  expenses and taxes incurred  both local and  foreign in the cause of this transfer  needless to  say  the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous  in  return we demand your  complete honesty and trust   you must however note that this transaction will be  strictly based  on the following terms and conditions as we have  stated below   a  our conviction of your transparent honesty and  diligence  b  that you would treat this transaction with utmost  secrecy and confidentiality  c  that you will not ask for more share or try to  sit on the funds once it is under  your custody  or any form of blackmail   d  that upon receipt of the funds you will release  the funds as instructed  by us after you have removed your share of   from  the total amount   please  note that this transaction is   legal and  risk free and we hope to conclude  this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days  from the date  of receipt of the necessary requirements from you   we are looking  forward to doing business with you and solicit your  total confidentiality  in this transaction  there is no cause for alarm  i  give you my word that you  are completely safe in doing business with us   transactions like this  have been successfully carried out in the past by  most government  executives  here in my country there is great  economic and political  disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant  and the order of  the day  thus explaining why you might have heard  stories of how  money is been taken out of nigeria  this is because  everyone is  making desperate attempts to secure his or her  future

i and soon to be commissioned phase  ii of    mw  to other needy  states  considering the high cost of power generated from dpc  which during  the recent months has hovered around rs  per unit as against an average cost  of rs        a unit from central and state utilities  there would be few  takers for the power from dabhol  the power minister reportedly said    deficit states will buy dpc power only when the cost of power is brought  down   he said  adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this power  to the buyers                                      business standard  monday   may   reliance allowed to hawk power from patalganga to third parties  arijit de  s ravindran  renni abraham in mumbai  in an unusual departure from normal practice  the maharashtra government has  allowed the reliance group to sell power generated by its   mw patalganga  power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state  electricity board  mseb  does not lift power  the project \\x01  s power purchase  agreement  ppa  has a clause to this effect  the state government \\x01  s  permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in the  context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power  company \\x01  s bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to third  parties   dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the company \\x01  s  application had been pending with the chief minister \\x01  s office for months   only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to  negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state  the dpc project  is facing the threat of closure following mseb \\x01  s inability to buy power from  it  thanks to the board \\x01  s weak financial position  not only can the  reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra  but it can  sell power to utilities outside the state  the ppa does not expressly bar it  from doing so  nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power  can be sold  so  in effect  this suggests that the group could sell power to  industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival to  the mseb  the state electricity board derives over  per cent of its revenue  from such consumers   apart from captive power plants  independent power producers in india are  allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards  they can sell power  outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status  with  its   mw capacity  the patalganga project is not eligible for such status  because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of     mw  speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week  reliance  industries managing director anil ambani told business standard  a provision  in third parties  ambani was answering a question on whether the mseb \\x01  s weak  financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised  in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would  derail the patalganga project   the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outside  the state  a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response  to questions  a senior mseb official explained that the state government  cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the  unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former  mseb official  subsequently  it was realised that the state would be stuck  with excess power  so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to third  parties  he said  the patalganga project along with the ispat group \\x01  s     mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submits  its second  report                                      the economic times  may     no need of patalganga  bhadravati power  mseb  the axe seems to have finally fallen on the much  delayed reliance  industries  promoted patalganga and ispat industries  bhadravati power  projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the  government that  there is no need of these projects nor their power   the  loss  making board has communicated to the government that mseb had  no  interest  in patalganga and bhadravati  as it did not have escrow  able  capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  tremendously in maharashtra  state government sources said here on sunday    in last november itself  mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds   including they being unviable and  unaffordable   sources said   reliance  s project is no different from that of  dpc  s  patalganga is also naphtha  based and its ppa is on similar lines     after the enron experience  mseb cannot even dream of another gas  based  power plant in the state   a senior mseb official said  he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the   mw  patalganga and the     mw coal  based bhadravati   as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances   when contacted  mseb chairman  vinay bansal said   reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee  s recommendations   but expressed inability to give  further details   currently  bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report  which was set up to review the dpc  mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra   can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover   the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives  to which the reply had been negative  sources added   sources said  as of now  both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a  guaranteed payment  mechanism from  mseb  which  incidentally it has promised to dpc   all the three were cleared  as  fast  track  projects  but other than enron  reliance and ispat have been  caught in a quagmire  especially bhadravati  which has been hanging afire  since last nine years   they added   moreover  the mseb official opined that given the current situation  if dpc  calls it quits from india  bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance  s  patalganga  patalganga  s power would be mere  paise less than that of dpc  s  that ranges anywhere around approximately rs    per unit to as high as rs    while bhadravati  s cost could be around rs    to rs  per unit  he  informed  mseb  s installed capacity ended on march     wasl    mw and  it has generated    million units with transmission and distribution  losses as high as  per cent   pti                                      business standard  may     global bankers ask govt to honour dpc obligations  tamal

mseb   in a related development  the dpc has sent a note  to all lenders saying they would have to bear the consequences of the turn  of events as they have prevented the dpc from serving the ppa termination  notice last month   the lenders  in their turn  sent a statement   prepared by the new  york  based legal firm white  case   defending their stance saying they are  working in the best interest of the project  the lenders are expected to  meet in london over the next fortnight to take stock of the situation  the  deadline for resolving the issues are drawing to a close as  days of the  three  week reprieve have passed  at the dpc board meeting in london on may    the lenders had managed to stall the issuance of the termination  notice and got three weeks \\x01  time for themselves to convince the centre as  well as the maharashtra government to resolve the impasse on the  controversial project  in a letter to finance secretary ajit kumar dated  april   the global arrangers said the government must own up its  responsibility and meet its obligations without further delay  among the  stiff conditions  set by the arrangers  are the demand that the central  government ensure payment of all the pending bills of mseb for december    january   february  and march  which remain unpaid  without any protest or reservation by may   monday    any payment previously made under \\x01  protest \\x01  should be made free and clear of  such protest or any other reservation  and the center should ensure timely  payment of future bills by mseb  they said  meanwhile  sources said that the  finance secretary was expected to meet the international lenders to the  dabhol projects in london stand on the issue  the lenders \\x01  list of demands  also include asking mseb to take steps required under the existing  contracts to activate the escrow arrangements put in place at the time of  financial close of phase ii of the project by may    they have demanded that the union government and the maharashtra government  should take all required actions to ensure that no government agency will  take any step to impede the operation of phase i or the construction and  operation of phase ii without due cause  the lenders have also asked them to  ensure that the relevant customs authorities permit import of all goods and  equipment required for the

global arranger for phase ii  did  not sign the letter   ten days have passed since the lenders bought three  weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of  the ppa  since then  nothing has moved at the material level barring mseb  s  payment of the january bill to the tune of rs  crore under protest   said  a source among the global arrangers  come forward to meet its obligations  the lenders are planning to meet around mid  may in london and this time  they will be left with no choice but to give the go  ahead to the company to  terminate the ppa unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the  issue  the source added  the lenders are  however  not ready to take the  blame for any delay in the termination of ppa as implied by the company  the  white  case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of the  project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the  last option   termination of ppa

participation as equipment supplier to the controversial     mw power  project in maharashtra  being set up by the dabhol power company  bechtel is  the epc contractor to the project while ge has supplied the equipment   primarily turbines  general electric  like bechtel  also holds  per cent in  dabhol power company  dpc   and both bechtel and general electric are worried  about future payments from dpc  sources familiar with the project said that  so far dpc has not defaulted in its payments to general electric  what is  worrying general electric is the possible scenario after june   when about   mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs   dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board  mseb  have been locked in a  payments dispute for months  if mseb continues with its stance  dpc in turn  may not be able to pay general electric  in such a situation  ge may walk out  of the project  a final decision will be taken only in june  said sources   general electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by business  standard  senior executives at its public relations agency burson  marsteller roger pereira said that only dpc executives were authorised to  speak on the issue  the dpc spokesman declined to comment on the issue   the first phase of the  mw has already been commissioned  after the second  phase of    mwis commissioned by december    mseb will have to pay  dpc a minimum of rs  crore per month  the escrow account for this was to  have been made operational by april     mseb has refused to do this   earlier  dpc had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract  with the board  mseb is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has  absolved dpc of all its liabilities   consequently  it will not operationalise the escrow account  this casts a  further shadow over dpc \\x01  s ability to pay general electric and bechtel  this  is worrying the lenders to the project as well  the situation has

defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due  to power  shortages  it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced  by the dhabol plant  expensive as it may be   the power cut affected   million people   the second article is enron specific   vince  asia  pacific  power failure hits north india  financial times  jan     by angus donald  tens of millions of people were left without electricity  in northern india  yesterday after a power grid breakdown   electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and  most parts of the  capital new delhi  with  to  per cent of supply  expected to be restored  by the end of the day  according to power grid  officials   the associated chambers of commerce and industry   assocham   a  leading business organisation  expressed  deep concern   and called for a  mechanism to prevent future disruption that could   cripple the economy    the power failure across eight indian states  including  new delhi  disrupted  train services  water supplies and the telephone network  and forced  hospitals to switch to emergency generators   the fault occurred on the northern grid  which provides  electricity for  m  people  and affected the states of delhi  haryana   punjab  uttar pradesh   himachal pradesh  madhya pradesh  rajasthan and jammu  and kashmir   a breakdown at a sub  station in kanpur in uttar pradesh   india  s most  populous state  caused an overload of power on other  lines  which then  failed as well   trains stopped running for most of the day and signals  systems were  damaged  new delhi international airport was also  slightly affected before  its own power supply could be engaged    we will probe into the reasons for the failure  it is  most likely to be a  technical failure  but we will investigate why it  happened   suresh prabhu   the power minister  was quoted as saying by press trust  of india   india suffers regularly from power problems because of  lack of funding to  upgrade infrastructure  theft of supplies is also a big  problem  thirty per  cent of the country  s electricity is stolen  according  to analysts  in new  delhi as much as  per cent is stolen   two years ago  a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh  and delhi for  hours   assocham issued a statement  saying that increasing  industrial demand  would exacerbate the problems already faced by india  s  inefficient power  sector   the slow progress  particularly in  strengthening the transmission  and distribution system  and ever increasing theft will  contribute to  worsening the power supply situation further    copyright  the financial times limited   copyright the financial times limited    ft  and  financial times   are trademarks of the financial times  privacy policy  terms jan     by khozem merchant  enron  the us energy producer and a constant target of  criticism in india  is  hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a  profiteering  multinational   its  myth and reality  offensive in local newspapers  follows the west indian  state of maharashtra  s decision to review the tariff it  pays the texas  based  company  whose dollars    bn electricity generating  plant at dabhol is  india  s biggest single foreign investment   maharashtra  s tariff has more than doubled since   and is three times  greater than that charged by other independent power  producers  ipps    the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the  rupee against the  dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha  fuel  the state also pays  a fixed capacity charge of rs  m  dollars  m  a month   reflecting the  huge project cost and  controversially  irrespective of  consumption   a showdown looks inevitable  reminiscent of a clash six  years ago that  damaged india  s appeal to foreign investors  a former  official of the world  bank  which has criticised the deal  says enron is  emerging  as the east  india company of the  st century   a reference to the  british trader that  colonised key areas of the indian economy in the  th  century   the stand  off is the latest blot on india  s power  sector  the uk  s powergen  and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently   frustrated by long approval  procedures  inadequate payments mechanisms or because of  higher  returns elsewhere    india has lost time and opportunity and has driven  returns down by six  percentage points   says gerry grove  white  former india  general manager  of powergen  which has sold its  mw plant in gujarat  to china light   power of hong kong   india  s national plan for the five years to  says  generating capacity  must rise by    mw to about    mw  but since    ipps have  added only    mw and    mw remains under  construction  this is  insufficient to support official projections of  to   per cent economic  growth   enron was a bellwether of india  s liberalisation   winning fast  track project  approval in the early  s  phase   a  mw plant  fuelled by expensive  naphtha came on stream in may   and phase   a  dollars    bn plant  of    mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied  natural gas  lng    will be completed this year  only two of seven other  fast  track proposals  have achieved financial closure   from the outset enron encountered attacks  culminating  in maharashtra  s  then nationalist government cancelling the project  before renegotiating  terms no less onerous  vilasrao deshmukh  chief minister  of the successor  government  says the power purchase agreement is  unaffordable   enron  whose attackers also include cultural  chauvinists  wants to maintain  good political relations in a hostile but lucrative  environment  enron views  india as a testing ground for its evolution from a  traditional manager of  power plants to a broad  based trader of commodities   such as energy  gas  and bandwidth   to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy  between power  surplus and deficit states  once legislation is passed  this year  it is building  an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural  gas  and it is  laying a    km fibre  optic network to trade bandwidth  space in a country  desperately short of this new economy commodity   in any event  enron believes it has a watertight  contract  it is supported by  many that believe any subversion of the contract would  confirm investor  perception of maharashtra  india  s financial and  industrial hub  as an  unreliable destination for investment   mr deshmukh  who has avoided the language of his  predecessor  which  threatened to  dump dabhol into the arabian sea   is  under pressure from  radical members of his wobbly coalition  but his options  are limited   scrapping the project would be ruinous for an  economically troubled state  that would have to compensate shareholders   maharashtra state electricity board  the local utility  and enron  s main  client  is obliged to dispatch or  off  take   per cent  of dabhol  s output  yet  mseb has never honoured these guarantees  its off  take  has averaged   per cent since the plant opened and  in effect  mseb has  been paying a lot  more while consuming a lot less power   one reason off  take is low is because the state  s tough  new regulator has  told mseb to buy from cheaper sources  enron says the  tariff would be  rs     kwh if mseb  s off  take averaged  per cent  but  with off  take a  third lower  the average tariff is rs    per unit  and  often higher  in  october  the tariff was rs    per unit  when off  take  was about  per  cent  enron says tariffs should come down when phase    run on cheaper  lng  starts   these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only  half of a  per  cent equity option in phase   enron has acquired the  balance and  mandated bankers to find a buyer   enron  s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps   which have failed to  deliver the flood of investments  potential ipps feared  they would never be  paid by state generating boards that have become a  byword for corrupt  management of power   reform of state electricity boards  whose uneconomic  pricing means  industrial users subsidise poor farmers  as well as  transmission and  distribution  t  d  services to check huge theft and  technical losses  is  overdue   given the limited resources  money would be  better spent on t  d  rather than on new plant   says oliver blackaby   managing director of n m  rothschild in india  which is advising karnataka on the  privatisation of its  distribution network   for the moment

is this still possible   we  realise that you are extremely busy  so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something  which is below  and if you want to review  change or re  write  the  preface  that would be very appreciated   let me know what your thoughts are     thanks   julie   we  re getting close       preface        one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives  pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible  to discuss  in  depth the models  and to show how they relate to each other   in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models  price a wide  range of energy derivatives  or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework   we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad  hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets  see also others who propose  consistent models     however  it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models  at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user  although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model  s  we prefer    we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs     in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into  chapters   in  chapter  we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book    in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black  scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing  which are used throughout  the book     in chapter  we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices   as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices   we look at the well  know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion  stochastic volatility  and jump processes  discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated     chapter   written by vince kaminski  grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp   discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets    this chapter builds on the previous one   it examines in detail the methods   merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter    examples from crude  gas  and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility     chapter  examines forward curves in the energy markets   although such  curves are well understood and straight  forward in the most financial  markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves   in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments   we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets  the arbitrage approach  the econometric  approach  and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors     chapter  presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses   examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps  caps  floors and collars  as well as  energy swaptions  compound options  asian options  barrier options  lookback  options  and ladder options     chapter  investigates single and multi  factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives   closed form  solutions for forward prices  forward volatilities  and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor  stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model     chapter  shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter    simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options   in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities  a trinomial tree scheme is  developed   this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options     chapter  describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve   the approach  results in a multi  factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves   the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form   closed  form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options  and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options   the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options     chapter  focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions    in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time   we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging \\x01   illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models   the  general model presented in chapter  is ideally suited to multi  factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed     chapter  examines the key risk management concept of value at risk  var   applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products   after  discussing the concept of the measure  we look at how the key inputs   volatilities  covariances  correlations  etc  can be estimated   we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var  delta  delta  gamma   historical simulation and monte  carlo simulation  applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options   in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables     finally  in chapter  we review modelling approaches to credit risk   we  look in detail at two quite different approaches  creditmetrics  j  p  morgan      and creditrisk   credit suisse financial products     for which  detailed information is publicly available   together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk   we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives     before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the \\x01  tool \\x01  and the market works   the techniques we describe are  certainly not \\x01  magic wands \\x01  which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions   to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document \\x01  \\x01  no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk  \\x01    however   the right tools  correctly used make the job a lot easier',\n",

              " 'subject status  vasant   i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home  and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back   i wanted to give you an update of the eol project  the gas model  and of my  intentions here at enron   software  in compiled c on the unix platform  has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades  process them  book them  and file them away  in  addition  software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis  and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis  it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes   these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas  for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data   i am in the process of documenting all of this for you   with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq  dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq  to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq  i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell  the new machine  will be here any day now  no financial obligation to anyone   and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq  specific   i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you   i  ve tried to do my best for you  vasant  but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here  just the  other day  sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn  t enough free space on the server  s hard drive for the workfiles  in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading  people whom i have known for over  years  they indicated they were  ubiquitous here  the power traders have similar pc  s to my new one  and they  have complained from day  that theirs are slower than their old ones  also   there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses   during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this  when i have been told of tools available for real  time  data harvesting  my requests for such have typically been met with  well  we  have it  but we haven  t really tested it yet   an example is the weather  we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite   my interests here are to help enron to do well  because i will do well only  if enron does well  these aren  t empty words  my ira is   invested in the  enron stock fund  i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling  and the difficulty working in the  research group  in terms of systems development  is that  frankly  few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems  we aren  t  directly generating revenues for enron  and we aren  t really their customers   except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses   as it happens  power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person  and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job  reporting to  george hopley  it is a wonderful opportunity for me  vasant  as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders  access to real  time fundamentals data  i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research  i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines  they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for  year  and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission  we agree the move is good for enron  we all  work for enron  and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it  they are comfortable with me  they have known me for years  as a hard worker  honest and unpretensive  they have already ordered a  state  of  the  art unix workstation and server for me  and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful   including hiring an analyst to work for me  and  i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here   so  i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening  it would be  a lateral move in position and salary  and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database  i will continue to work on their improvement  and complete their  documentation   as it happens  i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday   and will be back wednesday  i had wanted to talk face  to  face instead of by  email  but enron business supercedes  i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support   clayton',\n",

plan   california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade  expected    billion power bill this summer   economic crisis would force deeper  administration involvement   qf bid for advance payments from pg  e likely to fail in bankruptcy court   new generation delays probable because of state  qf squabbling   consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout  deal    ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks  like action  but is not  rather  it allows the situation in california to  continue to develop virtually unabated  the political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame  once they are politically inoculated  the  administration can begin to look at regional solutions  moreover  the  administration has already made explicit  and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming cheney commission report  its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation   it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan     something less than effective price caps  from davis  s point of view  the ferc plan has four major flaws    the order applies only to california  not to the rest of the west   non  california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  california    as the order is written  it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling    state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system  because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage   emergency and does not require any collusion    even when the price caps kick in  they are based on the cost  plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap  the generators can also charge above the  cap  provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc     proposal  kill clause  adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a  kill clause  that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless california  s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the  regional grid now under ferc control  if davis doesn  t sign on to the  regional grid by june lst  then he will have to live with june  nd headlines  blaming him for letting the  bush price caps plan  collapse     growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as   billion  on power this summer  this is more than the combined enterprise value of  pg  e and sce  these sources believe that  because of the severity of the  situation  the ferc and  or the federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for power   the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about   days  one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long  term power deals   the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to california   the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture  the country  s largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months     qfs to seek advance payment from pg  e  meanwhile  on the bankruptcy front  the qfs reportedly will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge  s accounts   since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for  gas  it appears very unlikely that the qfs  request will be granted  if the  qfs do not receive advance payment  it is likely that most of the    mw  of gas  fired qf capacity will remain offline    delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long  term contracts are being  continually renegotiated  which is likely to mean that the new plants those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated     consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan  the analysis was done by a  utilities analyst  rather than a lawyer  though it appears to raise a number  of good legal points  for example  one of the elements of the mou is a   non  bypassable  charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid  this is effectively a tax  since there is  no exchange of value for money  which under the ca constitution cannot be  used to directly benefit a private entity  this makes the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds  rather than revenue bonds  according  to the constitution  the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private  company  for this and other reasons  even if the republicans would vote for  the sce bailout  which remains unlikely  the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge     governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long  term power contracts  the issue of the governor  s failure to disclose the details of the long  term  power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis   even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating  it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged  creating an even further delay',\n",

of this  message for further information and removal instructions   parents of   year old  find     cash hidden in  his closet   does this headline look familiar  of course it does  you most likely have  just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program  usa    and reported elsewhere in the world  including my neck of the woods   new zealand   his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when  she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried  beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her   year  old  sons closet  nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when  she opened the bag and found it was full of cash  five  dollar bills  twenties   fifties and hundreds  all neatly rubber  banded in labelled piles    my first thought was that he had robbed a bank   says the   year  old  woman   there was over     dollars in that bag   that  s more than my  husband earns in a year    the woman immediately called her husband at the car  dealership where  he worked to tell him what she had discovered  he came home right away  and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up  little did  they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than  actually finding it in the closet   as it turns out  the boy had been sending out  via e  mail  a type of   report  to e  mail addresses that he obtained off the internet  everyday  after school for the past  months  he had been doing this right on his  computer in his bedroom    i just got the e  mail one day and i figured what the heck  i put my name  on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out   says the clever    year  old   the e  mail letter listed  addresses and contained instructions to send one    dollar bill to each person on the list  then delete the address at the top  and move the others addresses down  and finally to add your name to  the top of the list   the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand  dollars in five  dollar bills within  weeks if you sent out the letter with your  name at the top of the   address list   i get junk e  mail all the time  and  really did not think it was going to work   the boy continues   within the first few days of sending out the e  mail  the post office box  that his parents had gotten him for his video  game magazine subscriptions  began to fill up with not magazines  but envelopes containing   bills    about a week later i rode  my bike  down to the post office and my box  had  magazine and about  envelops stuffed in it  there was also a  yellow slip that said i had to go up to the  post office  counter  i thought i  was in trouble or something  laughs    he goes on   i went up to the  counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me  i had to ride back  home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all   over  the next few weeks  the boy continued sending out the e  mail   the  money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the  closet  barely had time for my homework   he had also been riding his bike  to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the   bills for twenties   fifties and hundreds    i didn  t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks  with like five thousand at a time in my backpack  i would usually tell the  lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the  money  and he was outside waiting for me  one time the lady gave me a  really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me  and my dad would have to come in and do it  but i just rode to the next  bank down the street  laughs    surprisingly  the boy did not have any  reason to be afraid  the reporting news  team examined and investigated the so  called  chain  letter  the boy was  sending out and found that it was not a chain  letter at all  in fact  it was  completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws  title    section  and   or title   section  in the us code  also in  the code of federal regulations  volume   sections  and   which  state a product or service must be exchanged for money received   every five  dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read    please send me report number xyx   this simple note made the letter  legal because he was exchanging a service  a report on how  to  for a  five  dollar fee    this is the end of the media release  if you would like to understand how  the system works and get your      please continue reading  what  appears below is what the  year old was sending out on the net   you can use it too  just follow the simple instructions    be financially free like others within a year    before you  say  bull   please read

show to the investigation of this program described below  to see if it really  can make people money  the show also investigated whether or not the  program was legal  their findings proved once and for all that there are   absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if  people can follow the simple instructions  they are bound to make some  megabucks with only   out of

had to say   thanks to this profitable opportunity  i was  approached many times before but each time i passed on it  i am so glad i  finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal  effort and money required  to my astonishment  i received total        in  weeks  with money still coming in    pam hedland  fort lee  new jersey   here is another testimonial   this program has been around for a long time  but i never believed in it  but one day when i received this again in the  mail i decided to gamble my   on it  i followed the simple instructions  and walaa

support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance  bridge loan by the may  th deadline  any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart  according to sources  both the republicans  and democratic caucuses are turning against davis  the democratic caucus is  reportedly  unwilling to fight  for davis  many legislative republicans and  democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that  once the  bonds are issued to replenish the general fund  davis would  double dip  into  the fund  clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor  however  it is believed once davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated  a bond issuance will take place   additionally  some generator sources have reported that some of the long  term  power contracts  as opposed to those still in development  require that the  bond issuance happen by july     if not  the state may be in breach of  contract  sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by may  th  having a bond issuance by july lst will be very  difficult   the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would  eat  the   billion cost of power spent to date out of the general  fund  thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately    billion  however  the reportedly now are not going to offer even this  concession  sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor  s plan for handling the crisis  including the  details and terms of all long  term contracts he has negotiated  before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward   currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan  ab  x and ab   x  ab  x authorizes the dwr to sell up to   billion in bonds  this bill  passed the senate in march  but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of  republican support  ab  x deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts  however  sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen   currently in ab  x  senator bowen  s language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments  which  if passed  would be  likely to cause a socal bankruptcy    according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature   republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the general fund  for instance  tony strickland has stated  that only    of the bonds  or approximately   billion  should be issued   other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds  the  republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday  additionally   lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan   key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount      b  lenders  jp morgan     b  lehman brothers     b  bear stearns   m  tax exempt portion  of the     b      b is expected to be tax  exempt  projected interest rate  taxable rate      tax  exempt rate      current projected  blended ir       maturity date  august     for more details please contact me at        bill sb  x passed the senate yesterday  but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb  x yesterday  which authorizes   billion to create the  california consumer power and conservation authority  the   billion  authorized under sb  x is not the same as the   billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased  or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward  again  the republicans are not in support of these  authorizations  without the details of the long  term power contracts the  governor has negotiated  the republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support  no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb   x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power  also  there is no staff  defined purpose  etc  for  the california public power and conservation authority  however  this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates  who began promoting this  idea earlier in the crisis   socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point  two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy  the  first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the  governor  the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is  august  th  however  some decision will likely be made earlier  according  to sources  the state has yet to sign the mou with socal  though socal has  signed it  the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis  and the senate lack the votes needed to pass  if the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the mou  socal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy  or its creditor  involuntary  due to the lack operating cash   the second likely triggering event  which is linked directly to the bond  issuance  would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb  x  bridge loan   stating that the dwr would received   of its payments from ratepayers   then the utilities would receive the residual amount  in other words  the  state will get paid before the utilities  if this language is included and  passed by the legislature  it appears likely that socal will likely file for  bankruptcy  socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the dwr proportionately from rate payments',\n",
